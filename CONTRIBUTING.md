## üéº Adding New Tags

### Tag Format

Tags should be submitted as Markdown files with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Tag Title"
tag_id: 1234
arranger: "Arranger Name"
difficulty: "Easy/Medium/Hard"
source_url: "https://www.barbershoptags.com/tags/1234"
date_added: "YYYY-MM-DD"
parts: 4
lyrics: "Optional lyrics for the tag"
comments: "Additional performance or arrangement notes"
---

Lead: 1 3 5 1
Bass: 1 1 3 1
Baritone: 3 3 3 3
Tenor: 5 5 5 5

Optional lyrics here
```

### Numeric Notation Guidelines

- Use numbers 1-8 to represent scale degrees
- 1 = Root (Do), 2 = Second (Re), etc.
- Each line should represent a voice part
- Use consistent spacing and formatting
- Include lyrics if available

### Parts Field

- Use an integer representing the number of voice parts
- Common values: 2 (duet), 3 (trio), 4 (quartet), 5+ (larger groups)
- This helps with filtering and categorization

### File Naming

- Use kebab-case for filenames
- Include the tag title in the filename
- Example: `sweet-adeline.md`, `goodbye-coney-island-baby.md`

### Submission Process

1. Create a new Markdown file in the `data/tags/` directory
2. Follow the format above with proper YAML frontmatter
3. Ensure the tag_id is unique
4. Submit a pull request with a descriptive title
