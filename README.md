Barbershop tags in numeric notation

## What is numtags?

numtags is a mobile-first web application designed specifically for barbershop singers to quickly find, learn, and share barbershop tags. Tags are short, harmonically rich pieces of music meant for spontaneous group singing. The app uses a custom numeric notation system that makes it easy to read, learn, and teach tags on any device.

## Features

- **Search**: Search by ID, title, lyrics, or arranger
- **Mobile First**: Optimized for mobile devices with PWA capabilities
- **Share as Image**: Generate images of tags to share 
- **Offline Ready**: Works offline once loaded
- **Filter & Sort**: Filter by difficulty, arranger, or parts
- **Open Source**: Openly licensed and welcoming community contributions
- **Dark Mode**: Because let's face it, we mostly sing tags at afterglows

## Numeric Notation System

numtags uses a straightforward numeric notation system where numbers represent scale degrees:

```
1 = Root (Do)
2 = Second (Re)
3 = Third (Mi)
4 = Fourth (Fa)
5 = Fifth (So)
6 = Sixth (La)
7 = Seventh (Ti)
```

Each line represents a different voice part (Tenor, Lead, Baritone, Bass), and the numbers show which scale degree to sing. Dots above and belowe show which octave the note is in.

### Example:
```
Tenor:      3 - 3 - | 4⁀4 3 - |
Lead:       1 - 1 - | 1⁀7̣ 1 - |
Baritone:   5̣ -♭7̣ - | 6̣⁀5̣ 5̣ - |
Bass:       1̣ - 5̣ - | 4̣⁀2̣ 1̣ - |

            "My town, my town."
```

|  1  3  5  |  4  6  -  1̇  |  1̇  —  |
|  1  1 ♯1  |  2 ♭3  -  4  |  3  —  |
|  1 ♭7̣  6̣  |  1  1  - ♭6̣  |  5̣  —  |
|  1  5̣  3̣  |  6̣  4̣  -  2̣  |  1̣  —  |
So tired of   wait-ing for   you.
```

### Mobile Formatting Guidelines

When creating tags, consider mobile display:

- Each staff contains 4 voice parts followed by their lyrics
- Use double newlines to separate different staffs
- Lyrics appear at the bottom of each staff
- Test your tag on mobile devices before submitting
- Long staffs will scroll horizontally on mobile to preserve musical structure
- Each complete musical phrase (4 voices + lyrics) stays together as one unit
